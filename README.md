This is a responsive website for a Anime based Discord Server named "AnimeKun", i wrote the content about what the server does, what the server provides & why it's best for joining. You can view the live version [Animekun.lol](https://animekun.lol).

## Features
- Fully responsive design
- Simple and clean UI
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- JavaScript for header & footer
- Used Google Search Console to index the site on google

## Motivation
This is a server i own that has 1900+ members by (September 15, 2024).
The server has season, when members talks there they get XP. Hence they level up & who ever reaches the top level, gets the reward(Nitro). Whenever someone reaches the top level, the server resets its levels & a season comes to an end. I had to make pages for season, put the images with their XP and the top 50 person who levelled up.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Google Search Console
- Bing Webmaster

## Workload
It took me 1.5 days to make this whole thing.
In the home section, i used a picture that fades to the left with a CSS property called "mask-image", and tried to put the content on a div with position - 'absolute'.
Some basic css styling & for indexing on Google & Bing i used basic SEO HTML stuffs so had to use Sitemaps & everything.
